Applicant Tracking System designed for small recruiting teams that want a simple, self-hostable alternative to complex enterprise ATS platforms.

Vriksham Jobs focuses on practical hiring workflows: candidate pipelines, structured evaluation, employer request handling, public career applications, and lightweight reporting.

Built for teams that want full control of their hiring stack without the cost or complexity of traditional recruiting software.

## Demo Environment

When demo mode is enabled, authenticated demo users see a one-time welcome modal with quick guidance. Configure a demo inbound email address before testing the Postmark inbound workflow; forwarded messages must include an email address that matches an existing candidate or contact record for processing to occur.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js `20.x` (see `.nvmrc`)
- npm `10+`
- MySQL `8+` (local install or Docker)

### 1) Clone And Install
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> vriksham-jobs
cd vriksham-jobs
nvm use || true
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2) Configure `.env` Minimums
```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/ats"
AUTH_SESSION_SECRET="replace-with-a-long-random-secret"
AUTH_APP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 3) Start MySQL
Local MySQL:
```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ats;"
```

Docker MySQL:
```bash
npm run db:up
```
Then set:
```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://ats:ats@localhost:3307/ats"
```

### 4) Bootstrap And Run
```bash
npm run bootstrap
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
On a fresh DB you are redirected to `/setup`.

If you are upgrading an existing DB, apply migrations first:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Onboarding And First Login
- There is no hardcoded seeded default admin user.
- Optional bootstrap provisioning can create a default admin from `.env` when DB has zero users.
- First user is created in onboarding (`/setup`) and becomes `Administrator`.
- Onboarding sets initial branding and theme.

Quick smoke test after first login:
1. Open `Admin Area > System Settings > System Diagnostics` and run diagnostics.
2. Create a Client.
3. Create a Contact linked to that Client.
4. Create a Job Order linked to that Client/Contact.
5. Create a Candidate.
6. Create a Submission for Candidate + Job Order.

## Configuration Model

### Admin UI Configuration (Database-backed)
Use `Admin Area > System Settings` for:
- Site name, logo, theme
- Public careers hero headline/body copy
- Career site enabled/disabled
- Client review portal enabled/disabled
- Google Maps API key
- OpenAI API key
- Bullhorn API credentials for background export jobs
- SMTP settings
- Object storage settings (`s3` or local mode)
- API error log retention days
- Operational-data purge with typed confirmation in the `Diagnostics` tab

When `DEMO_MODE` is enabled:
- administrators can still save the full branding card
- integrations, SMTP, and object storage settings remain read-only

System settings are split into:
- `Branding`
- `Platform Settings`

Use `Admin Area > Custom Fields` for:
- Module-scoped custom fields on Candidates, Clients, Contacts, Job Orders, Submissions, Interviews, and Placements
- Field-level validation (`text`, `long text`, `number`, `date`, `yes/no`, `select`)
- Required field enforcement on create/update forms

Use `Admin Area > Data Export` for:
- Export format selection (`JSON`, `NDJSON`, `ZIP`)
- Optional inclusion of audit trail and API error logs
- Incremental date-range exports using `updatedAt` (fallback `createdAt`)
- Export payload includes `customFieldDefinitions` so custom schema can be moved across instances
- Bullhorn API batch ZIP export for custom field definitions, clients, contacts, contact notes, candidates (including structured candidate skills), candidate notes, candidate education, candidate work history, candidate files/resumes, job orders, submissions, interviews, and placements
- Bullhorn export filters by created/updated date range and expands upstream dependencies so the exported batch stays importable
- Bullhorn export now also supports a preflight window estimate so administrators can see changed core-row counts by entity before starting a background job
- Bullhorn export keeps the run sample-sized with a per-entity changed-row limit before dependency expansion
- Bullhorn exports now run as background jobs in the admin UI, notify the requesting user when ready, and can be downloaded or opened in the import preview flow from the completed job
- Saved Bullhorn credentials can be managed in `Admin Area > System Settings > Platform Settings` so administrators do not have to re-enter them for each export
- Completed, cancelled, or failed Bullhorn export jobs can be deleted from the exports screen after confirmation

Submission workflows include a print-friendly `Submission Packet` from submission detail for internal review or browser PDF export. The packet compiles the recruiter write-up, primary resume link, candidate snapshot, cached match explanation, and recent interview prep/questions.

Use `Admin Area > Data Import` for:
- Source selection:
	- Native legacy export (`JSON`, `NDJSON`, `ZIP`)
	- Generic CSV migration batch with field mapping
	- Bullhorn CSV migration batch
	- Zoho Recruit CSV batch
- Native legacy import applies `customFieldDefinitions` first, then entity records
- Entity profile selection for CSV imports
- Generic CSV batch upload with per-file entity selection, auto-suggested field matches, and ordered apply
- Bullhorn batch upload with per-file entity review and ordered apply
- Bullhorn import/export preserves Bullhorn custom field definitions and record-level custom field values when the source includes them
- Bullhorn import/export now also carries candidate notes, candidate education, candidate work history, contact notes, and structured candidate skills inside the batch flow
- Bullhorn export/import now also carries candidate attachment files, including resumes, inside the ZIP batch when Bullhorn exposes downloadable candidate files
- Zoho Recruit batch upload with per-file entity review and ordered apply
- Generic CSV preview now acts as a safety check with per-entity create/update/skip counts, relationship warnings, row-level actions, match-reason visibility, and tabbed inspection before apply
- Every import source type now includes an in-app sample download link, including ZIP-ready sample batches for Generic CSV, Bullhorn, Zoho Recruit, and native legacy export testing
- `docs/import-samples/bullhorn-batch/` contains a clean Bullhorn-style sample batch with `customFieldDefinitions`, the core entity CSVs, note/education/work-history metadata CSVs, and a candidate resume/file payload for ZIP/manual importer demos
- `docs/import-samples/zoho-recruit-batch/` contains a clean seven-file Zoho Recruit-style sample batch for ZIP/manual importer demos
- Import preview before apply
- Profile template CSV download from the UI

### `.env` Configuration
Use `.env` for:
- Core runtime (`DATABASE_URL`, auth/session settings)
- Rate limits and security throttles
- Email safety routing (`EMAIL_TEST_MODE`, `EMAIL_TEST_RECIPIENT`)
- Ops and diagnostics knobs (backup/logging/alerts/preflight)

### Important Notes
- If object storage settings are missing or invalid, file upload falls back to local storage.
- `EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true` routes outgoing emails to `EMAIL_TEST_RECIPIENT`.
- For socket-based MySQL, include socket in `DATABASE_URL`, for example:
	- `mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/ats?socket=/tmp/mysql.sock`

## Operations
- Runbook: [`docs/OPERATIONS.md`](docs/OPERATIONS.md)
- Health endpoint: `GET /api/health`
- Admin diagnostics: `Admin Area > System Settings > System Diagnostics`
- Data export: `Admin Area > Data Export` (or `GET /api/admin/data-export` for native ATS snapshots, `POST /api/admin/bullhorn-export-jobs` to queue a Bullhorn export job, `GET /api/admin/bullhorn-export-jobs` to poll job status, `PATCH /api/admin/bullhorn-export-jobs/[recordId]` to cancel a queued/running Bullhorn export job, `DELETE /api/admin/bullhorn-export-jobs/[recordId]` to remove a completed, cancelled, or failed Bullhorn export job)
- Data import: `Admin Area > Data Import` (or `POST /api/admin/data-import`)
- Client review portal management: `Job Order Detail > Actions > Client Review Portal`

Data export query options:
- `format`: `json` | `ndjson` | `zip`
- `includeAuditLogs`: `true`/`false`
- `includeApiErrorLogs`: `true`/`false`
- `dateFrom`: ISO datetime (optional)
- `dateTo`: ISO datetime (optional)

Data import form fields:
- `mode`: `preview` | `apply`
- `sourceType`: `hire_gnome_export` | `generic_csv` | `generic_csv_manual` | `generic_csv_zip` | `bullhorn_csv` | `bullhorn_csv_manual` | `bullhorn_csv_zip` | `zoho_recruit_csv` | `zoho_recruit_manual` | `zoho_recruit_zip`
- `file`: upload file (`.json`, `.ndjson`, `.zip`, or `.csv` based on source)
- `genericBatch`: JSON array of CSV-batch entries containing `entity`, `mapping`, and file field keys (preferred when `sourceType=generic_csv`)
- `genericEntity`: legacy single-file generic entity selector (still accepted when `genericBatch` is not provided)
- `genericMapping`: legacy single-file generic mapping object (still accepted when `genericBatch` is not provided)
- `bullhornEntity`: `customFieldDefinitions` | `clients` | `contacts` | `candidates` | `jobOrders` | `submissions` | `interviews` | `placements` (required when `sourceType=bullhorn_csv`)
- `zohoEntity`: `clients` | `contacts` | `candidates` | `jobOrders` | `submissions` | `interviews` | `placements` (required when `sourceType=zoho_recruit_csv`)

Sample generic migration batch:
- `docs/import-samples/generic-migration-batch/`
- Includes a clean seven-file CSV set in dependency order for demos and importer testing.
- `docs/import-samples/generic-migration-batch-messy/`
- Includes a second seven-file batch with messier legacy column names for mapping demos.

Kanban status update endpoints:
- `PATCH /api/candidates/[id]/status` with `{ "status": "...", "reason": "..." }`
- `PATCH /api/job-orders/[id]/status` with `{ "status": "open|on_hold|closed" }`

Native legacy export/import coverage:
- Export includes `customFieldDefinitions`, core entities, and related child records.
- Import upserts `customFieldDefinitions` by `recordId` or `(moduleKey, fieldKey)` before entity rows.
- Import applies `customFields` payload values on supported entities, including Submissions, Interviews, and Placements.

Archive behavior:
- Archive is soft-delete and reversible through the Archive module.
- Certain archive actions can optionally cascade to related records via UI selections during archive flow.

Demo instance reset behavior:
- `demo:reset` preserves `System Settings` (branding/theme/integration keys) by default.
- If no `System Settings` row exists, demo seeding creates one with default branding and enables the public career site.
- Seed creates realistic linked records across all core modules.
- Seeded public job postings include richer, role-aligned career-site descriptions.
- Seed avoids duplicate human-readable names across seeded users, contacts, and candidates.
- Seed-mode reset clears all `customFieldDefinitions` so custom fields do not persist between demo reset cycles.
- Default seeded login users use `AUTH_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`.
- For interval resets, either:
	- run `npm run demo:reset:loop` (uses `DEMO_RESET_INTERVAL_MINUTES`), or
	- schedule `npm run demo:reset` with cron/systemd (for example every 6 hours).

Inbound email webhook:
- Postmark inbound webhook endpoint: `/api/inbound/postmark`
- The route extracts email addresses from the payload, matches `Candidate.email` and `Contact.email`, creates cleaned `Email` notes on matches, and saves supported attachments to matched candidates only.
- Contact matches receive notes only. Attachments are not saved to contacts.
- Duplicate inbound processing is suppressed by Postmark `MessageID`.
- Matching is based on any email addresses found in the inbound JSON payload, including common reply/forward content.
- Candidate attachments are saved only when the inbound payload includes attachment bytes, not just metadata.
- Recent inbound events and attachment skip reasons are visible in `Admin Area > System Settings > System Diagnostics`.

Client review portal:
- The client portal can be disabled globally from `Admin Area > System Settings`.
- Internal users can issue a persistent magic link from `Job Order Detail > Actions > Client Review Portal`.
- Portal access is scoped to the job order's assigned client contact and remains valid for the life of the job unless revoked.
- Internal users can copy, open, email, revoke, or restore the portal link from the job-order modal.
- Portal email sends use a branded HTML invite that follows the selected admin theme, with a direct CTA, job title context, and a plain-text fallback.
- Portal management shows lifecycle analytics for sent, opened, last viewed, acted on, and total client actions logged on job order detail and in the modal.
- Clients can review submitted candidates, read the recruiter write-up, download only the candidate's labeled primary resume, complete a simple scorecard (`Communication`, `Technical Fit`, `Culture Fit`, `Overall Recommendation`), leave comments, request interviews, or pass.
- Client responses are written back to `Submission Detail > Client Feedback` with the structured scorecard and generate in-app plus email notifications for users who keep `Client Feedback Notifications` enabled in `Account Settings`.
- If `POSTMARK_INBOUND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set, include it either as `?secret=...` on the webhook URL or as the `x-webhook-secret` header.

## Production Checklist
- Set strong unique values for:
	- `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET`
	- `DATABASE_URL`
	- `AUTH_APP_BASE_URL`
- Set `EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true` during staging/testing.
- Set `EMAIL_TEST_MODE=false` only after SMTP and recipient routing are validated.
- Configure system integrations in Admin settings:
	- SMTP
	- Object storage
	- Google/OpenAI keys as needed
- Run:
	- `npm run ci:preflight`
	- `npm run build:deploy`
- Validate backup and restore before go-live:
	- `npm run db:backup`
	- `npm run db:restore -- --input <backup-file> --drop-first`

## Troubleshooting

### `Unexpected token .` from Prisma CLI
You are running an old Node version. Use Node `20.x`, reinstall dependencies, rerun command.

### `migration ... was modified after it was applied`
Your local migration history drifted. For local development only:
```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
```

### `Unknown argument ...` from Prisma
Schema and database are out of sync. Apply latest migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Build logs DB socket warnings during SSG
Ensure `SKIP_SYSTEM_SETTINGS_DB_DURING_BUILD=true` (default) so system settings are not read during static build phases.

### Existing browser session loops between `/login` and `/` after deploy
This is usually stale auth cookies after a deploy or secret/session changes.
- Refresh once and retry login.
- If needed, clear site cookies for the app domain (`ats-session`, `ats-acting-user-id`) or open `/api/session/logout`.
- New private/incognito windows are typically unaffected because no stale cookies exist.

### Cannot connect to MySQL
Verify:
- MySQL is running
- `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- database `ats` exists
- socket path is set when using local socket-based MySQL
