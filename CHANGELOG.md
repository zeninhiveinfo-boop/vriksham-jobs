# Changelog

This changelog captures product-facing changes for the ATS now branded as Vriksham Jobs. Older entries may refer to the upstream project identity where that history is useful for context.

## [Unreleased]

#### Changed
- Candidate detail now includes a timeline-aware `Suggested Next Step` card in the snapshot area, with direct action links for likely recruiter follow-up.
- Candidate names now display as `Last, First` in candidate-linked table/list views so sorting is more natural across candidates, submissions, interviews, placements, and job-order workspace lists.
- Added a clean generic CSV migration-batch sample under `docs/import-samples/generic-migration-batch/` for importer testing and demo walkthroughs.
- Generic CSV migration batches now support ZIP intake in the admin UI so multi-file migrations can be loaded in one upload, and a second messy-source sample set now lives under `docs/import-samples/generic-migration-batch-messy/`.
- Generic CSV preview now works as a tabbed safety check with per-entity create/update/skip counts and relationship warnings instead of a flat count summary.
- Bullhorn import/export now preserves Bullhorn custom field definitions and record-level custom field values. Bullhorn API export batches now emit `00-custom-field-definitions.csv`, Bullhorn direct-import consumes that file first, and Bullhorn CSV imports can also create fallback custom field definitions from detected custom columns when no definition file is present.
- The Bullhorn sample batch now includes custom field definitions plus example custom columns on the entity CSVs, and the downloadable Bullhorn sample ZIP was refreshed to match.
- Bullhorn export jobs now open the finished ZIP in the normal Bullhorn ZIP import preview flow instead of applying the import immediately, so administrators can review the safety check before import.
- Bullhorn API credentials can now be saved in admin platform settings and are reused by background Bullhorn export jobs.
- Bullhorn export jobs can now be cancelled while queued or running, and completed/cancelled/failed jobs can still be deleted after confirmation.
- Bullhorn exports now let administrators choose whether candidate resumes/files should be included, instead of always pulling them into every job.
- Bullhorn migration batches now also carry candidate notes, candidate education, candidate work history, contact notes, and structured candidate skills, and the Bullhorn sample ZIP was refreshed to include those metadata CSVs alongside the candidate file manifest.
- Bullhorn imports now use the same staged batch model as generic CSV, including ZIP/manual intake, per-file entity review, preview safety checks, and dependency-ordered apply so related clients, contacts, candidates, and job orders migrate together.
- Bullhorn batch imports now also cover submissions, interviews, and placements, and a clean seven-file sample batch lives under `docs/import-samples/bullhorn-batch/`.
- Bullhorn export/import now also carries candidate attachment files, including resumes, inside the Bullhorn ZIP batch, and the sample Bullhorn ZIP includes a candidate resume/file payload for migration demos.
- Zoho Recruit imports now use the same staged batch model with ZIP/manual intake, preview safety checks, dependency-ordered apply, support for submissions/interviews/placements, and a clean seven-file sample batch under `docs/import-samples/zoho-recruit-batch/`.
- Bullhorn and Zoho operations can now be disabled with environment variables, and the admin import/export UI hides those integrations when disabled.
- Admin import now includes per-source sample download links in the UI, including ZIP-ready sample batches for Generic CSV, Bullhorn, Zoho Recruit, and a sample native legacy export ZIP.
- Data export now includes a Bullhorn API batch ZIP exporter with created/updated date-range filtering, a per-entity changed-row cap, automatic upstream dependency expansion, background job execution, completion notifications, and direct import from completed export jobs.
- Bullhorn export jobs no longer duplicate the saved credential fields in the export form and now rely on Platform Settings for those values.
- Admin settings diagnostics now includes a destructive operational-data purge flow with typed confirmation, so administrators can clear ATS records and migration artifacts while preserving users, divisions, system settings, skills, custom field definitions, and zip codes.
- Import preview and import results now surface row-level actions plus explicit match reasons, so administrators can see why rows will update or skip before committing a migration.
- Bullhorn export now includes a preflight window estimate so administrators can see changed core-row counts by entity before starting a background export job.
- Placements now track recruiter and sales commission splits by user, role, split percentage, and commission % of gross margin, with 100% totals enforced per role and accepted placements still allowing commission-only edits.
- Validation status now uses compact red/green chips in the main migration and record-edit flows where the state is binary, and contact forms now surface inline email validation before save.
- Candidate list columns now also expose `Skills` and `Files` as optional selectable columns.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-17

#### Changed
- Added a submissions-count column to the job order list so recruiters can see pipeline volume from the main list view.
- Added explicit candidate resume labeling on file attachments, including automatic labeling for known resume upload flows and clearer portal resume presentation.
- Improved the demo seed so recent portal and resume workflows open with more representative data, including seeded primary resumes and client-review activity.
- Refined client portal feedback so `Pass` is confirmed, locks the submission against further client actions, and only the clicked action shows a saving spinner.
- Client portal `Pass` actions now also push the submission to the bottom of the job order's priority ranking, the job-order submissions workspace surfaces the latest client response more clearly, and the portal itself is now limited to the candidate's labeled primary resume.
- Added a user-level `Client Feedback Notifications` setting so portal responses only notify users who have opted in through Account Settings.
- Added an in-app portal email workflow so recruiters can send the persistent client-review link directly to the assigned contact from the job-order portal modal.
- Client feedback notification opt-ins now trigger actual email alerts in addition to in-app notifications.
- Portal management now tracks and displays sent/opened/viewed/acted-on analytics directly on job order detail and in the portal modal.
- Added a global client-portal toggle in admin settings so teams that do not use external client review can disable the feature, hide passive portal UI, and keep the actions-menu entry as a guided prompt.
- Added structured hiring-manager scorecards to the client portal so clients can rate communication, technical fit, culture fit, and overall recommendation, with the ratings written back to submission detail and included in portal feedback emails.
- Split system settings into separate branding vs. platform cards so branding can always be saved, while integrations, SMTP, and object storage stay separately saveable and remain demo-locked.
- Added configurable public careers hero headline/body copy in branding and tightened the public careers stat boxes so they no longer read overly wide.
- Upgraded client-portal invite emails to a branded HTML template that follows the selected theme, with a clearer CTA, job context, and matching plain-text fallback.
- Audit trail viewing is now restricted to administrators in both the detail-screen UI and the audit-log API.
- Added explicit submission-level client portal visibility so web responses stay differentiated and hidden by default until a recruiter promotes them for client review.
- In demo mode, system settings now allow the full branding card to be saved while keeping integrations, SMTP, and object storage read-only.
- Reorganized admin system settings into separate `Branding`, `Platform Settings`, and `Diagnostics` tabs so the page stays usable as more controls are added.
- Added a print-friendly submission packet from submission detail that compiles the write-up, primary resume, candidate snapshot, match explanation, and interview prep for internal review or PDF export.
- Upgraded the dashboard `Needs Attention` queue with smarter workflow alerts for web responses, client portal engagement, unscheduled interview requests, and other stale follow-up states.
- Added live dashboard KPI cards for web-response review and client interview requests so the home screen surfaces new recruiting pressure sooner.
- Added a stronger candidate snapshot header with AI summary snippet, last activity, and profile-completeness guidance so recruiters can assess submission readiness at a glance.
- Added unified timeline panels on candidate, job order, and submission detail so recruiters can review recent workflow activity in one chronological feed instead of jumping between separate sections.
- Extended candidate completeness into the list view and added soft submission warnings so recruiters can keep moving while still seeing when a profile needs cleanup.
- Owner performance chips in operational reporting now open the same drill-through detail modal used by the rest of the report, filtered to that owner and metric.
- Expanded the list-view column chooser so core module lists expose more hidden-by-default optional columns without changing the default layouts users already know.
- List-view column preferences now persist per user account instead of only in the browser, so customized column layouts carry across devices.
- List-view column choosers now support drag-and-drop column ordering, with the custom order saved per user while untouched lists still keep the default order.
- Added per-user saved views across the main pipeline lists so recruiters can save named filter and column-layout sets, apply them later, and set personal default views across devices; submissions now support explicit origin filtering and job orders can be filtered by client-feedback presence for more useful view definitions.
- Main list tables now sort ascending by the first column by default, and saved views now preserve explicit sort order alongside filters and column layout.
- Split production scripts so app-only builds and deploy-time migrate+build runs are explicit, keeping server deploys automatic while preventing CI build jobs from requiring a database.
- Added a real advanced-search builder to the job-order list so recruiters can combine structured criteria like date ranges, submissions thresholds, owner/client filters, and career-site state without overloading the global search bar.
- Applied the same advanced-search pattern to the candidates list so recruiters can combine structured filters like owner, source, completeness, counts, and last-activity dates while keeping the basic search box simple.
- Candidate advanced search now includes a real `Skills` filter that matches structured candidate skills and the freeform skill-set field.
- Candidate advanced search now also supports `Resume Keywords`, backed by a stored primary-resume search index that updates when the resume file changes.
- Applied the same advanced-search pattern to the clients list so recruiters can combine structured filters like owner, status, note counts, job-order counts, and last-activity dates while keeping the basic search box simple.
- Applied the same advanced-search pattern to the contacts list so recruiters can combine structured filters like client, owner, status, note counts, job-order counts, and last-activity dates while keeping the basic search box simple.
- Applied the same advanced-search pattern to the submissions, interviews, and placements lists so recruiters can build structured list filters there as well, while keeping the basic search box simple.
- Placement chips now use success-style colors in timelines, dashboard recent activity, and reporting so accepted outcomes no longer read as warning/error states.
- Added a generic CSV migration-batch import path in `Admin Area > Data Import` with multi-file entity staging, auto-suggested column mapping, template downloads, dependency-ordered apply, and relationship resolution via IDs, external IDs, record IDs, and name/email fallbacks.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-17

#### Added
- Added a client review portal with persistent magic links tied to the job order's assigned client contact, allowing external users to review submitted candidates, download resume/files, leave comments, request interviews, and pass without creating a login.
- Added internal portal management on job-order detail plus submission-level client feedback visibility so recruiters can issue, revoke, and track portal activity from existing workflow screens.

#### Changed
- Refined the portal management modal controls and button presentation so the client-link actions read cleanly as part of the same portal release.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-03-17

#### Added
- Added branded custom 404 and 500 error pages with dedicated artwork for not-found, route error, and global error states.

## [1.3.15] - 2026-03-16

#### Changed
- Match explanation modals now auto-generate the explanation on open when no cached explanation exists yet.

## [1.3.14] - 2026-03-16

#### Changed
- Kept open job orders matchable even when current submissions meet or exceed openings, so candidate and job-order match views continue surfacing possible fits.

## [1.3.13] - 2026-03-16

#### Fixed
- Prevented workspace save/action buttons from stretching full width so note and other inline actions keep consistent content-width sizing.

## [1.3.12] - 2026-03-16

#### Fixed
- Tightened the shared list-table actions column so single-icon open actions consume less horizontal space.

## [1.3.11] - 2026-03-16

#### Changed
- Removed direct archive actions from list rows and moved record archiving into the detail-screen actions menus with confirmation prompts.

## [1.3.10] - 2026-03-16

#### Changed

## [1.3.8] - 2026-03-16

#### Fixed
- Matched the candidate AI Summary header button size to the adjacent actions button so header controls align cleanly.

## [1.3.7] - 2026-03-16

## [1.3.6] - 2026-03-16

#### Changed
- Candidate AI Summary now starts generating automatically when the summary modal opens and no stored summary exists yet.
- Candidate AI Summary documentation now reflects the modal-based flow instead of the old workspace-tab wording.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-03-16

#### Changed
- Moved the candidate AI Summary trigger out of the actions menu and into a dedicated header action.
- Updated the AI Summary modal to use compact icon-based generate/refresh controls instead of a large text button.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-03-16

#### Changed
- Moved candidate AI summaries out of the workspace tab strip and into `Actions > AI Summary`, opening the summary in a dedicated modal with in-place generate/refresh.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-15

#### Fixed
- Hardened `/api/lookups/contacts` and `/api/job-orders/[id]/matches` so demo environments with optional schema drift degrade cleanly instead of returning `500` for missing optional fields like `divisionId` or `publicDescription`.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-15

#### Changed
- Standardized fallback actor labels so `Unknown User` is capitalized consistently anywhere the UI shows missing authorship information.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-15

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### 2026-03-15

#### Added
- AI candidate summaries on candidate detail, generated on demand from resume, skills, work history, education, and recent notes.
- AI client submission write-ups on submission detail, with generate/refresh and copy-to-clipboard controls.
- AI interview question generation on interview detail, with saved, editable question sets and copy support.

- AI email drafting for candidates and contacts from the actions menu, with purpose, tone, optional instructions, and copy support.

#### Changed
- AI-triggered controls now stay visible but disable cleanly with hints when OpenAI is not configured in system settings.
- Submission write-up generation moved out of the actions menu and into toolbar controls above the write-up field.
- Match lists now use icon-based explain actions instead of text buttons to reduce row clutter.

#### Fixed

- Match panels suppress extra empty-state and sort UI when an eligibility warning is already shown.
- Dashboard right-side badges were reworked back into proper wrapped pill styling.

### 2026-03-14

	- administrators see everything
	- directors see records they have access to
	- recruiters see only their own reporting data
- Report drill-through modals from summary cards and pipeline counts.
- Excel export for operational reporting with summary and entity tabs.

#### Changed
- Reporting defaults now use a last-7-days date range to keep the initial view tighter.
- Daily activity trend and owner performance layouts were tightened and visually aligned.
- Report exports were simplified so each entity tab mirrors the record detail shown in the UI instead of dumping raw generic columns.

#### Fixed
- Excel exports now use proper datetime cells and valid workbook styles.
- Owner performance no longer shows duplicate or misleading `Unassigned` rows for recruiter-scoped reporting.
- Recruiter rows in owner performance are now alphabetized.

### 2026-03-12

#### Added
- Kanban pipeline views for candidates and job orders with drag-and-drop status movement.
- Candidate and job-order match workspaces gained clearer fit explanation workflows and cleaner row actions.
- Expanded custom field coverage for submissions, interviews, and placements.

- Additional admin diagnostics surfacing for operational support and troubleshooting.

#### Changed
- Admin area cards were regrouped into clearer sections so configuration, billing, users, exports, imports, and diagnostics read more cleanly.
- Mobile and list-view layouts were refined to reduce wrapping, overflow, and noisy controls.

#### Fixed
- Session and demo-instance behavior was hardened around rebuilds, onboarding flows, and demo reset expectations.
- More list and workspace interactions now use consistent modal/confirm patterns instead of browser-native alerts.

### 2026-03-10

#### Added
- Dashboard refresh toward action-first workflows with KPI cards, needs-attention views, upcoming interviews, recent candidates, and recent job orders.
- Public careers experience improvements for seeded demo data and public job descriptions.
- Broader seeded demo data coverage for realistic records across industries and workflows.

#### Changed
- Demo seed data was cleaned up to better distribute dates, vary activity totals, and avoid duplicate seeded names across entities.
- Seeded job orders no longer all receive the same number of submissions, making match and submission workflows easier to test.

#### Fixed
- Seed data quality issues that made matching and dashboard/testing scenarios too uniform.
- Duplicate-name collisions across demo users, contacts, and candidates.
